<b>Pretty Little Liars </b>

<hr>

This responsive website was created for one of my favourite tv shows "Pretty Little Liars", based on Author Sara Shepard's best selling novels "Pretty Little Liars" series. HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used while creating this website.

I came up with an excellent idea of creating my website. I wanted to use my favourite show, Pretty Little Liars. 

As you can see in the video, firstly, a video appears on the website which includes "-A scene" then we see a picture with quotes from PLL. We have a video again, says "follow me end up like me". When it is pressed cross, redirect is set to the home page. 

I have informed you about the show. "All -A thing (game) started because of a mean girl. Alison Dilaurentis."

You can get information about the show, Alison Dilaurentis, you can watch trailer and see imdb page. You can learn about -A Theories, Main Characters, Who is -A?.... 

This website has navigation bar, responsive navigation bar, slider, responsive slider, footer, responsive footer.
