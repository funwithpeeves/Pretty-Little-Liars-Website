          <p>Alison always said that Emily was her favorite, but it’s no secret that the Rosewood High swimmer was growing tired of Ali’s on and off act by the time of her disappearance. Let’s examine why the “weak link” of the liar quad could be secretly involved with the A team.

                     Alison pushed her too far. Alison loved to toy with Emily’s emotions and in several flashbacks we’ve seen just how much this pull and push was affecting Emily emotionally. Emily had seemingly had enough of Alison toying with her emotions, as we learn that she had written Alison a note stating exactly how she felt about being used as a pawn. It is possible that Alison became frustrated by her house of cards crumbling and decided to offer Emily an ultimatum that she refused and then went on to seek revenge on Ali for the years of torment.
            
                    Emily has a dark side. Emily is the only liar that we know of that is actually capable of murder. When Lyndon (aka Nate) trapped Emily in the top of the lighthouse, she proved that she had what it took to stand her ground and stop her attacker for good. Later, once she was in therapy for the attack, Emily visits the night that Alison’s body was dug up and the night that she disappeared via Hypnotherapy. The two memories were definitely crossed, but why would Emily remember herself (she is seen in the flashback wearing the same purple outfit that she was wearing the night that Alison disappeared) holding a shovel and Alison pleading for help if she hadn’t had some sort of altercation with her former BFF?
            
                    She may be the weakest link, but she has several connections. Emily is connected to Toby directly via friendship and was also close friends with Garrett before he joined the Rosewood PD. Her mom’s job at the police department gave her easy access to things within the station as well as an alibi for why she may be in the station. She is also on the swim team, giving her both the strength to carry out A team tasks that require more muscle as well as a convenient excuse (swim meets and practice) for alibis. Emily is also the shyest of the PLLs with a big soft side for those who were mocked. It is possible that this naïve front gave her the perfect cover for A team action.
            
                    She asked to be in on the action. Let’s not forget that in season 4 when Emily was getting fed up with Mona 2.0 going MIA after the RV went missing that Emily asked Mona directly to be in on the action. It is possible that even if Emily was not involved with the A team before, that Mona allowed her in after this plea.</p>

          <p>I tend to not lend much credibility to this theory, only because Alison ended up being the Big A in the book series, right after none other than Mona was the first A. I highly doubt the writers of the show would take the teen drama down the exact same path as its preceding book series. Real life factors aside, let’s examine the facts on why Rosewood’s favorite mean girl might still be pulling the strings in a big way.

            Alison started it all. When it all boils down to it, Alison’s mean ways are what got the ball rolling on all of it. Everyone who has been confirmed to be on the A team so far has had one hell of an axe to grind with Ali.
            The First Secret could have been an act. We know now that the infamous blonde faked her own death, a feat she no doubt pulled off with a great deal of help. Ali could have devised the plan to have some act as if they were blackmailing/threatening her so that they could create a believable excuse for her disappearance and supposed murder. Those wanted ads in the paper that Alison was passing back and forth with A could have easily been a test for her to determine who in Rosewood  had the brains to help her pull of her fake death.
            All roads lead back to Ali. All the connections and A clues always seem to tie back to Alison; from Wren to possibly Ezra. It seems improbable that both Ali and head A would both have the same networks of people. Paige, CeCe, Noel, Jenna, Garrett, Ian, Toby, Mona, Lucas, and basically anyone else mildly sketchy in Rosewood had a past with Alison and that is not likely a coincidence.
            Ali was a bully before her disappearance. Let’s face it, Alison showed no mercy to her friends and enemies alike. If she managed to have that great of a following in life as a bully, imagine the things she could cook up while everyone is under the impression she is gone. She has demonstrated time and time again on the show that she has the questionable morals necessary to act as A.</p>

          <p>“The bolder the move, the less anyone questions it.” It would be just like the producers/writers of the show to lead us down a path with Toby making him out to be a concerned boyfriend who joined the A team to protect Spencer only to reveal him in the end to be the mastermind behind it all.
            Those sinister looks can’t be all for nothing. When Toby was first revealed to be working for Mona he looked like he had a serious chip on his shoulders towards the girls and Alison, much like he did at the beginning of season one. It would make perfect sense if Toby really did have an issue with the girls and was just getting close to them in order to make them suffer the way that he suffered for their mistake.
            Ezra isn’t the only one who disappears for long periods of time. Let’s face it; Toby has taken several long, unexplained trips that could easily be explained with A-filled activities. A lot of this just matches up too nicely and these trips did not start after his job in Bucks County.
            He has access to almost all things liars. Being that is half of the beloved “Spoby” ship, he has access to the Hastings family and is privy to a lot of conversations he probably shouldn’t. He also holds a special place in Emily’s heart and she has confided in him on more than one occasion. His carpentry jobs have given him access to so many different locations and that trade would certainly give him the know how to plant some pretty spectacular spy equipment (007 anyone?).
            We (possibly?) have confirmation that “Uber A” is male. The summer season finale certainly made it seem like the lair that the liars were guided to was the home of this “Uber A” character. The closet in the lair provided an interesting twist, this particular tormenter seems to be a man. While suit jackets don’t really seem like Toby’s style, we have no idea what his possible alter ego could don when in character.
            Toby and Alison didn’t exactly leave things in good terms. The last time we saw Ali and Toby meet in a flashback, she was threatening him to stop sending her “A” notes and he was telling her if he found out who was behind them he’d “offer his services.” I mean he literally said if given an opportunity to work for A to take Ali down, he’d be all over it. I think that his bitterness towards Ali is genuinely enough to make him want to do anything, even betray the girls he is close to, in order to make sure she gets what she deserves. Speaking of Toby/Ali flashbacks, Ali wasn’t exactly the most sympathetic person when it came to Mrs. Cavanaugh. With the knowledge that Dr. Palmer provided, Toby could be more convinced than ever that Ali was behind his mother’s demise. 
            
            Toby knew about A from the beginning. We learned from Toby’s flashback of Ali visiting him in juvie that Alison let him know about the A messages (to which he replied that he wasn’t sending them and that he would offer his services to the mystery person who was messing with her). So even if Toby wasn’t in on the A madness at this point in the game, he was aware and never mentioned this to Spencer or told her that Alison was in the same type of position. </p>

          <img src="images/spencer-hastings.webp" width="250px" height="200px" alt=""> <br><br>
          <p>It’s easy to watch Pretty Little Liars and decide that Spencer has perhaps gone through more than any of the liars on the show. From discovering Jason is her half-brother to surviving her sister marrying and conceiving a child (maybe…) with Alison’s alleged killer to discovering what she believed to be the dead body of her boyfriend in the woods, it’s apparent that Spencer Hastings has been put through the wringer since A has been calling the shots in the girls’ lives. After all, Spencer was the one who snapped and landed herself a short stay in Radley Sanitarium. But behind that concerned friend, doting girlfriend, and damaged victim, could there lay the personality that is actually behind it all? Let’s delve into why the know-it-all perfectionist may in fact be A.

                     That picture perfect résumé could prove handy for more than just college applications. We all know that well-rounded Spencer keeps up a handful of afterschool activities at any given time. Not only do these activities give her opportunities and networking to access the school whenever she might need to, they also give her an access to appear busy when she would really need to ditch the girls for A team activity. The girls, and her family for that matter, would never be the wiser to her scheming.
            
                   She has a bad-Ass boyfriend. Not only does Toby have a rockin’ body that could no doubt protect Spencer in any number of scenarios, but he has also spent some time in the black hoodie. Spencer and Toby could have easily decided to work together to take down Alison, whom they both had reasons to drag off her high horse. With Toby’s mother’s murder/accident/suicide situation pointing more and more towards Alison intervention by the episode, this could very well be the reason Toby could be after Alison and willing to help  Spence in her pursuit of Ali.  
            
                    She’s got the book smarts for it. Spencer has proven time and time again just how clever and mentally superior she is to the other liars and most of the students in their school. She is right up there with Mona is terms of brainpower and it wouldn’t be surprising if she had either helped Alison plan her disappearance or decided to make Alison skip town in her own covert way. We know that Spencer and Alison had many a power struggle and Spence had become extremely fed up with Alison’s manipulation and games. In addition to Spencer’s shrewdness, she is also uber-observant. Spencer seems to always be at least one step ahead of the other girls when it comes to decoding A’s cryptic hints and puzzles. This could be because of her intelligence, but it could also be because she’s the one calling the shots.
            
                     OCD seems to be Spencer’s blood type. She is extremely detail-oriented and tightly wound, leaving herself no room at all for error. The scenes that we have seen at the end of each episode that give us insight to A’s goings-on seem to portray a very thorough, organized person. In fact, it would be extremely difficult for someone who wasn’t compulsive to pay enough attention to details to cover their trail. Spence definitely has what it takes to fulfill the sleuthing that is required to work on the A team.
            
                     Driven is her middle name. As Spencer explains to Wren early on in the series, the Hastings girls are expected to be as close to perfect as they can. They are extremely tense and hard on themselves because this is the way that they are raised. It is apparent throughout the series that Spencer gives 100% to everything that she does. This kind of personality is both the kind that would allow their resentment for someone to manifest itself in an elaborate revenge plot and the brand that would not only think of all the little details needed to pull a scheme off without a hitch but also to have the enthusiasm to carry it out completely and flawlessly.
            
                     She is the most committed to finding Alison, questions be damned. While most of the girls have been left in a tailspin by A many times over, Spencer has always continued to press forward for answers and put the pieces back together to solve the puzzle at all costs. Once the girls found out that Alison was alive, Spence didn’t need any recovery time at all to jump back into action seeking out where her former BFF was hiding. She inspired the girls to sit their feelings and questions aside and focus on finding Alison so that they could sit down and ask her themselves what went on and why. (Come to think of it, Spencer was the one who decided to pilfer in the closet around the time A broke in to snatch the journal…). She could easily be trying to push this hunt forward so that she can uncover Ali’s hiding place for herself.
            
                     She has already rocked the black hoodie once. We can’t forget that Spencer was actually recruited to work with Mona for a brief spell after she had her unforgettable meltdown in the woods that lead to her stay in Radley. That meltdown, by the way, seemed very rehearsed once in Radley and when picked up in the woods and ultimately seemed to be a scheme planned by Spencer to get into Radley to dig up some dirt. If Mona saw the potential and Spencer was able to execute her assigned tasks with no hesitance, I’m sure she is capable of more destruction.
            
                    She has a network of protectors. Has anyone else noticed that everyone always claims that they’ve been involved with A/NAT Club in order to protect Spencer? Garrett, Melissa, and Toby have all claimed that protecting Spencer was their motive. Jason and Spencer’s parents also seem to have done a good deal of sticking their necks out for Spence. Could it be that people were looking to help her succeed in her goal?

        <h2 class="aa"><br><br> 5- Aria is A?<br></h2>
         <hr>
         <div class="article">
          <img src="images/ariam.avif" width="250px" height="200px" alt=""> <br><br>
          <p> Aria had the most to lose if Alison’s secrets got out. Alison had a stockpile of secret built up about nearly every person in Rosewood, her best friends included. One secret in particular could have ruined Aria’s family—and did once it finally got out later in the series. It would make a lot of sense if Aria took over the torment and decided to blackmail Ali back in order to keep the secret under wraps until she found her own way (ahem, type written note, anyone?) to inform her mom about the affair.

                    Aria was sick of Alison’s control. In “The First Secret” we see just how sick Aria is of Alison’s manipulation and control. She could have easily decided to turn the tables in order to run Alison off (or attempt to do away with Alison) for good.
            
                    Aria seems a little too trusting of Ezra and his seriously sketchy behavior. Throughout season four, Ezra has had his share of dark, seriously suspicious moments. Even once Jake warned Aria about his temper-flared run-in with the woman in town, Aria defends and excuses Ezra’s behavior. Once she confronts Ezra about what Jake shared with her, she gladly takes his story and moves forward with their lovey-dovey date night with not the slightest look of suspicion. Either she is really head over heels in love with Ezra and willing to look past what would look really bad to any girlfriend of someone living a double life, or Aria herself is actually living a double life (and we don’t just mean lying to her friends about her relationship status) and she is already abreast of Ezra’s situation and either doesn’t mind, is in the process of helping, or is the one doing the manipulation.
            
                    Aria has had the least amount of misfortune of any of the liars. It’s possible that this is a coincidence, but it seems like despite Aria’s irrational life choices she seems to escape more A torture than the other girls. Sure, she was trapped in the box on the Halloween train, but a) we can’t prove that Wilden was doing that for A , and b) that could have been a distraction so that an accomplice could get to Garrett. It’s like Spence/Ali say, the bolder the move, the less anyone questions it.
            
                     Aria knew where the magic show was in Ravenswood. Despite a web search turning up nothing, Aria knew to click on what seemed to be an ad on the side of the search page. Also, once in Ravenswood, Aria leads the way through the town to the actual show. Furthermore, her hesitance to get in the box could be explained as her stalling to allow an accomplice to get into position to snatch Emily. She also had plenty of time to send that text while she was “disappearing.”
            
                     The Grunwald and Alison believe that one of the liars cannot be trusted. Alison’s first “dream” visit to Aria seemed to be the most vicious and also the most self-invested of them all. She didn’t actually help Aria out of the danger that she was in with Meredith, she just warned Aria not to trust the tea. She also just seemed to need the diary pages that Aria was hiding from her father and Meredith. Perhaps the most obvious clue in her visit to Aria is “you know why I chose you, right?” Of course, this could mean any number of things, but it could also mean that Alison chose Aria to resume her mean girl bidding after her disappearance. This does of course contradict the idea that Alison and Grunwald don’t trust Aria (Alison reveals this to Emily in their visit and Grunwald seems to focus on Aria when she says that Alison doesn’t want to be found and that the girls shouldn’t be so sure that Alison can trust them). This could be explained by Aria originally having the intention of helping Alison/working with her, and then Alison realizing that Aria’s loyalty lies elsewhere.
            
                     She seems the least driven to search for and help Alison. Spencer is losing sleep over it, Emily is throwing all worry aside and going into potentially dangerous situations in order to meet Alison, and Hanna is giving the detective work her all, but Aria just seems to be apathetic. She is just in her own little boy crazy world and not really concerned about what is going on with her former BFF.</p>

         <div class="article">
          <img src="images/Melissa-Hastings.webp" width="250px" height="200px" alt=""> <br><br>
          <p>She has some mighty suspicious love connections. Melissa has been linked romantically to Ian, Garrett, Wren, and possibly even Wilden. It can’t be a coincidence that she has control over so many people in so many different occupations all over Rosewood. Furthermore, Melissa never really seems to completely cut ties with anyone that she has broken up with, always leaving that door open, just in case. 
                  She’s a proven damn good liar. Let’s not forget that Melissa actually went as far as to fake her own pregnancy for several months. She claims that she was being blackmailed by A but that could have easily been an act to throw the liars and others that were suspecting her off her trail.
                  She has too many secrets to count. From the worried, hushed secret whispered in her father’s ear about the girl that was found in Alison’s grave to the claimed protection of Spencer that she used to excuse her suspicious behavior at the mask maker’s shop, it is obvious that Melissa keeps a lot of secrets. Anyone with that many secrets is obviously unable to let go of something in the past.
                  It is likely that Melissa took on the persona of A due to her deep-rooted hatred for Alison. The two were always competing over the attention of guys all over town. The two have very similar personalities that no doubt often times clashed. The family ties that exist between the girls due to Mrs. DiLaurentis and Mr. Hastings’ affair no doubt made things even tenser between the girls.
                  There seems to be a clear connection between Hilton Head and Alison’s disappearance. From what we know so far, Alison and Ian went off to Hilton Head in an effort to get away. This caused Melissa to be extremely angry, coming down to the room they were sharing and demanding to see Alison. From the looks of the video that was taken that night in Alison’s room, it looked like she hadn’t taken much time to cool off. Perhaps her knowledge of the videos being stolen pushed her over the edge.
                  She’s also been known to be working with Wilden. They were both on the boat in Cape May with CeCe and Alison and they were both working together on the Halloween train, supposedly due to A’s blackmail. It’s unclear if they actually dated but they were definitely connected and A seemed to think that Wilden needed to be taken care of. Perhaps he learned too much about Melissa from working with her and she realized she needed to take care of that?
                  Melissa was a major player in the Thornhill Lodge fire that was intended to trap Alison, Spencer, Aria, Hanna, Emily, Mona and Toby. She was working with Jenna and Shana (possibly Wilden too) and was seen by Emily saying, “those bitches will all be there” referring to the liars. That is definitely not someone who was just involved to protect her kid sister. Also, according to Mona and also apparent to the audience, Shana and Jenna seemed to be afraid of and submissive to Melissa. Maybe that is because she’s calling all the shots in the A game.
                  She is working with Mona’s Army. In the first episode of season 5, Mona makes it clear to Alison that she no longer needs to hide behind the veil of A and will be forthcoming to her about how she feels about her. It’s possible that Mona had a change of heart, but it’s more likely that someone took the game over from her and Mona realized that she is now in charge of her.
                  Melissa is basically the only person that is smarter than Spencer on the show. She definitely has the brains and know how to pull of the A game and not get caught, not to mention she is super resourceful. She has been linked to nearly every character on the show and is a genius at getting others to do her dirty work for her, which is very characteristic of A.</p>

          <p> According to what we have seen so far, Jenna has lost the most due to the liars and Alison. Both in the show and books alike, Jenna paid the dearest price for the liars stunts during Ali’s rule. The prank with the stink bomb left Jenna blinded. Despite the surgeries originally returning some of her vision, Jenna has continually battled with this struggle to regain her eyesight, serving as a constant reminder of what the girls did to her. Furthermore, in the show, Jenna has been forcing herself on Toby and seems to be in love with him. When Alison forced Toby to take the blame for the accident, he was sent away to juvie for the stunt, causing Jenna further pain as she was then separated from someone that she loved.

                     Speaking of Toby, she could explain his longstanding involvement with the A team. While Mona claims that she had only recruited Toby when he took the job in Bucks County, some little details about that just don’t add up. For starters, it seems like Toby was trying awfully hard to get in with Emily and Spencer in the first season when he had previously had nothing but harsh feelings towards the girls for what they had done to Jenna. Jenna could have easily been using Toby to get information about the girls early on.
            
                     Her minions are a’ plenty. Jenna seems to have no problem whatsoever luring sidekicks in. She’s had Toby, Noel, Shana, Nigel, Garrett, and now Sidney by her side helping her do her dirty work. Either Jenna has a much softer side that we haven’t been shown during the course of the show that people are really drawn to or Jenna has dirt on a lot of people and she’s not afraid to use it. Aside from Ali, A is the only other person on the show that we’ve seen amass and use secrets the way we believe Jenna has been using them to keep her help around.
            
                     Speaking of Jenna’s helpers, she is awfully good at playing the victim. What better excuse to keep people off your radar as a crazy stalker than to pretend to be helpless? We know that Jenna has faked being blind on the show at least once for her own protection. Who is to say that all of this isn’t an act again to protect herself?
            
                     Jenna seems to be tied in with darn near everything that happens to the girls. It’s hard to believe that Jenna is not involved in some capacity when her name comes up almost every episode. She was involved in the night Alison disappeared, though we still haven’t heard Alison’s version of that confrontation. She was involved in the Homecoming dance wherein Mona nearly drove Spencer off a mountain. She is involved with Melissa. She is involved with Mona and presumably her army. She was involved with the Halloween train. She was involved with the lodge fire. She could possibly even be linked to the showdown in New York between Shana and Alison.
            
                     She and Jason are the only survivors of the NAT club. It starts looking really bad when all of your associated friends “wake up dead” and you’re still fine and seemingly still in a place of power. Is it possible that Jenna and Jason have an understanding that the others weren’t originally privy to regarding that night? It could explain why the others are going missing and yet Jason and Jenna are still in relatively good places.</p>

          <p>As already stated, she has dated one of the main liars and that could give her a ton of intel regarding the liars lives and weaknesses. In fact, Spencer, Aria and Hanna have already suspected Paige as being involved with the A team but dropped their suspicions once Paige was kidnapped by Lyndon James. Lyndon trying to kill Emily and Paige was traumatic for all involved (especially Caleb who took a bullet for Emily) but it never did actually clear Paige’s name. It is revealed at the end that Mona was attempting to frame Paige for Maya’s murder but there is no confirmation that they were not acting against each other or that Paige was trying to be outed so that she would not be suspected later for something larger.

                    The way she pressed Emily about sending money to Ali seemed to reveal a whole new side to Paige. The Paige that demanded information from Emily and threatened (and acted on that threat) to turn a tip into the police that Alison was alive didn’t seem like the lost-in-love Paige we’re used to seeing. Perhaps she took the game over from Mona at some point to seek revenge for all that Alison had done and was continuing to do  by pulling Emily away from her.
            
                    She was bullied by Alison and desperately wanted Alison to disappear. Building on the previous post, Paige had just as much justification as Mona did for wanting to become A. Alison had taken Emily away from her and teased her ruthlessly. Paige told Alison herself that she wanted her to disappear and didn’t care what happened to her. Coming right out and saying it (though nearly everyone on the show agrees with wanting her gone) could clear her name off Alison’s list of suspects while allowing Paige to keep her edge.  
            
                   She’s been associated with Lucas, Melissa, and Mona via the Mona’s Army meeting. We can’t forget that Mona included her in the “army” meeting she planned prior to Alison coming back to Rosewood. It seemed like Paige was sticking around/attending so she could get the information on what they were planning, not so much because she felt like she needed to be protected from whatever Alison could bring when she comes back. Paige blends right in to so many atmospheres that it would be super easy for her to gather the information that she needs without wearing a disguise or raising any eyebrows.
            
                    She’s done a Mona-esque transformation since Mona went to Radley. When we first met Paige, she sloppy style, a moppy haircut, and very little self-confidence. She was scared for anyone to find out she was gay and even blasted Emily for being gay and stood by as her dad fought to have Emily removed from the swim team for her sexual orientation. Since she’s become involved with Emily (and really since Mona’s been in Radley) we have watched her transform to a more girly girl with confidence and passion. Her style has picked up and we’re now actually pretty jealous of her gorgeous locks. This parallel to Mona’s transformation surely isn’t a coincidence.
            
                   She’s already tried to kill Emily once.  Not to bring up “ancient” history, but we can’t lose sight of the fact that Paige did try to drown Emily once in the school pool. She obviously has an axe to grind with Alison, and by association, the girls for how she was treated when Alison ruled the school. Alison nicknamed her Pig Skin and tricked her into confessing her love to Emily only to snatch the letter to use as blackmail. It’s understandable but the motive is definitely there.
            
                     Paige has an athletic build to her. A lot of the stunts that A has pulled have required strength and agility, both of which Paige would have as a swimmer. Her being a swimmer also gives her motive for a lot of the absences that she would have to incur in order to pull off some of the A stunts.</p>
