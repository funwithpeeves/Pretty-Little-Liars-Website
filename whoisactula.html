            <h4>MONA VANDERWAAL</h4>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/monavanderwaal.jpg" width="300px" alt="">
           <p>Mona Vanderwaal was the progenitor of the A alias and the A-game. She was bullied and tormented by Alison DiLaurentis through high school, given the cruel nickname Loser Mona: The biggest loser of Rosewood for her geeky outfits and mannerisms. Mona wanted Alison to feel the fear that she inflicted on Mona daily. She adopted the alias A and sent Alison threatening messages. The messages escalated to the point where Alison no longer felt safe. After Alison's disappearance, Mona stopped using the alias and became Rosewood's new Queen Bee. She became best friends with Alison's former posse member, Hanna Marin, together they dominated the school in the sophomore year. While starting their junior year, Mona saw Hanna interact with her former best friends Spencer Hastings, the newly returned Aria Montgomery, and Emily Fields. She believed Hanna had left her for The Liars, and in turn, that the Liars had "stolen" Hanna from her. She restarted her A alias shortly before Alison's "body" was discovered, in the hopes it would tear the girls apart. Her plan backfired as it drove them closer together, and Mona became obsessed with the A-game.

            Her time as A was mainly spent threatening and blackmailing the Liars into doing demeaning tasks, humiliating them in public, or exposing their secrets. She was ultimately exposed as A in, "UnmAsked", and sent to Radley Sanitarium for intense psychiatric treatment. During her reign, Mona had the fewest number of A-Team members, using only Lucas Gottesman and Melissa Hastings - both of whom she blackmailed. After her release, Mona was surprised when someone else restarted her game. Intrigued and yearning to play the game again, she began helping the new puppet master, whose game was increasingly more volatile.</p>

            <h3>BIG -A</h3>
            <h4>CECE DRAKE/CHARLOTTE/CHARLES DILAURENTIS</h4>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/cecedrake.webp" width="300px" alt="">
           <p>Charlotte DiLaurentis was introduced to the game and the A alias during her time at Radley Sanitarium, where she met the recently admitted Mona Vanderwaal. Charlotte was intrigued by Mona, who she described as the, "craziest girl". She snuck into Mona's room for story time and would listen to all the ways Mona made The Liars suffer. Mona told Charlotte how "happy" the Liars were when Alison disappeared, which angered Charlotte. Charlotte was one of Alison's closest friends before her disappearance and her adoptive sister, though the latter was kept a secret. She planned ways to insert herself into the Liars' lives and escaped Radley to start her game. She became addicted to the power and upped the antics from Mona's original plans. She forced the Liars to commit crimes and break laws. She used their most dangerous and deadliest secrets to manipulate them to do her bidding, often times creating bigger secrets or crimes to further blackmail them with. When Mona was released from Radley, Charlotte integrated her into the A-Team, among several others including Jenna Marshall, Toby Cavanaugh, Spencer Hastings - a double agent at the time - Sara Harvey, and Noel Kahn. She also murdered Darren Wilden and was responsible for the deaths of several others. After Wilden's murder, Charlotte fled to France but returned when she had to satiate her addiction to the game.

            Her fantasy devolved and she saw the Liars as nothing more than dolls for her to play with. She wanted to play with them forever. She kidnapped Mona and framed Alison for Mona's "death" and then kidnapped the remaining Liars to hold prisoner in her dollhouse. She tortured them for weeks until they managed to escape. Charlotte and her primary helper Sara Harvey were ultimately revealed in, "Game Over, Charles", when Charlotte told Alison her origin story. Afterward, Charlotte's plan to murder herself and Alison was thwarted and she was sent to Welby State Psychiatric Hospital for intense therapy. She was released from Welby five-years-later and planned to restart the game upon her release. However, she was murdered before she had the chance.

            <h3>UBER -A</h3>
            <h4>ALEX DRAKE</h4>
            <hr>
            <img src="images/alexdrake.webp" width="300px" alt="">
           <p>After the murder of Charlotte DiLaurentis, her secret half-sister Alex Drake traveled to the United States to find Charlotte's killer. Alex mistakenly believed The Liars knew who the killer was, or that one of them had done it. She used violence, blackmail, and murder to try and force them to come clean. Whereas Mona and Charlotte could never be seen hiding in the shadows, this copycat A hid in plain sight, via masks and disguises. At the beginning of her game, Alex didn't sign her messages with the letter A. Instead, she used emojis, which differentiated her from the original A-Team and her predecessors. After Hanna claimed to be Charlotte's killer, Alex stopped using emojis and signed her messages with her initials, "A.D.". Like her predecessors, Alex became addicted to the game and wanted to push the boundaries of what was possible. She wanted to play with them as Charlotte once did. She built a board game to do so, Liar's Lament, which was one of the most dangerous moves she made.

            After successfully finding the killer and finishing Liar's Lament, Alex went dormant for two-years. She reappeared for Aria's wedding week. Alex successfully kidnapped her identical twin sister, Spencer, with her endgame being to kill Spencer and live her life. To ensure everyone would believe her, Alex had her boyfriend shoot her in the shoulder, she cut her hair, and adapted an American accent. Alex wanted friends that would do anything for each other, a family, and a sense of belonging. Upon convincing The Liars of her identity, Alex planned to murder Spencer and then their mother. She was stopped by Spencer, The Liars, and Toby Cavanaugh. She was then seemingly arrested by the police and taken into custody. Instead of being arrested, Alex was kidnapped alongside Mary Drake and taken to France, where they lived in an underground dollhouse owned by Mona Vanderwaal.</p>
